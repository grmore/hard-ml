# Problem 1. Estimating the probability of a type I error.
Write a function to evaluate the Type I error.

# Problem 2. Estimation of the probability of a type II error.
Write a function to evaluate the Type II error.
There are many ways to add an effect to an experimental group. The way in which the effect is added can affect the results of the statistical tests and the estimate of the Type II error probability. When performing a task, consider that the effect is distributed evenly over all objects of the experimental group, that is, the metrics of objects on average increase by the same amount.
